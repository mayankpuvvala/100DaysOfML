# 100 Days of Machine Learning

This is my journey of learning and applying machine learning algorithms and techniques using Python and PyTorch. I have completed various projects on different topics and datasets, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc. I have also explored some advanced topics, such as deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, etc. I have learned a lot from this challenge, and I hope to continue learning and improving my skills in machine learning.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you will need Python 3.7 or higher and the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pytorch
- transformers
- diffusers
- hugging face
- 

You can install these libraries using pip or conda. For example:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn pytorch
```

To clone this repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayankpuvvala/100DaysOfML.git
```

To run the notebooks, you can use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. For example:

```bash
jupyter notebook Abalone_NaiveBayes.ipynb
```

## Usage

This project contains various notebooks that demonstrate different machine learning algorithms and techniques. Each notebook has a title, a description, and a code section. The notebooks also have comments and explanations to help you understand the logic and the results. For example, here is a screenshot of the Abalone_NaiveBayes.ipynb notebook, which shows how to implement Naive Bayes classifier on the Abalone dataset. The goal is to predict the age of abalone age based on their physical measurements.

## Features

This project has the following features:

- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, etc.
- Application of machine learning techniques, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, optimization, production, etc.
- Visualization of data and results using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Use of PyTorch, keras as the main framework for deep learning.
- Use of Kaggle for cloud computing and GPU acceleration.

Some of the challenges or limitations of this project are:

- The datasets used are mostly small and simple, which may not reflect the real-world scenarios and complexities.
- The notebooks are not extensively optimized for performance or efficiency, which may affect the speed and accuracy of the models.
