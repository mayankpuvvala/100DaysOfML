# 100DaysOfML

Welcome to my machine learning journey! In this repository, I'm sharing my progress in the field of machine learning, covering both the theoretical aspects and the practical coding part. These materials are part of my coursework at IIIT Delhi for a Machine Learning course.

## Topics Covered
So far, I've delved into various machine learning topics, including:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Naive Bayes

## Dataset Usage
To keep the repository clean and efficient, I've opted to directly import datasets from external sources. You can find the dataset links within the code files. If you have any questions or need more information about the datasets or the code, feel free to reach out to me via email.

## Get in Touch
I'm passionate about machine learning and always eager to learn and share my knowledge. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about machine learning, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm here to help and discuss our exciting journey in the world of ML.

Feel free to explore the code and materials here, and happy coding! ðŸš€
